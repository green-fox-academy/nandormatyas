                <dt>Logic Gate</dt>
                <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>
                <dt>ASCII</dt>
                <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>
                <dt>RAM</dt>
                <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>
                <dt>Programming language</dt>
                <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</dd>
                <dt>Domain Name System</dt>
                <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</dd>
